title:  "The Open Source Soldering Iron"

This open-source soldering iron is supposed to close the gap between expensive high-quality professional soldering equipment and the backyard tinkerer.
It uses a industrial grade soldering tip and a rather inexpensive backend, which manages power control and offers a variety of features.

First off we'd like give some props to [Martin Kumm][arduino_shield] with his DIY soldering Iron stacked on an Arduino Uno.
Also some parts of the hardware designed are inspired by his approach.
He made us think about a Version with some more features and without the necessity of using an Arduino as a base board.

Our soldering iron features:

- AVR controller
- Fast heatup (2-3s from 20C to 350C) and stable temperature via pid controller
- Safety circuit to protect the hardware in any case
- Open Hardware / Software
- Different Temperature scales available (recompiling necessary)
