## GENERAL

## TIMER UTILIZATION

## PID CONTROLLER

In order to heat the soldering tip we used a standard pid controller and played around with the parameters to get them right.
Since the speed at which the temperature of the tip changes is (compared to our controller) incredibly slow we did not have issues of an oscillating temperature.
Right now we are sampling the tips temperature with 10Hz and adjusting the controller at the same pace.
This seemed sufficient so far.
