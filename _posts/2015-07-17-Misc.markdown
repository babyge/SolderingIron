## MISC

During the process of designing and building we realized that we all had different ideas of what our soldering iron should look like in the end.
One of us stuffed the soldering tip and its connector into a merchandise pen.
We purchased different power supplies and used a 3D printer to make our own handles.
Here are some impressions of what the first working soldering irons look like.

(Pictures coming soon)
