We started out with designing a fairly simple circuit consisting of an AVR ATmega328P a series of FETs, capacitors and a LM324.
It all was designed to be as cheap and easy to get as possible.
Pretty soon a three digit display got attached, a voltage regulator was patched in and buttons were added.
That was basically the first version of this soldering iron.

But we were not very happy with the results.
The LM324 was too unreliable in terms of measuring the same temperature with different LM324.
It just varied too much.
So we upgraded to an OPA336U.
The LM324 still stayed on the board and came in handy in another way.
Modern hardware like your smartphone cannot be physically broken by installing some software.
At worst you can make it unusable by bricking your device but you usually cannot make it go up in smoke.
We tried to achieve the same thing with this soldering Iron.
But doing this with a piece of hardware which is supposed to get hot is a lot harder.
So we built two protection circuits to prevent to soldering tip from dying.
- Over temperature protection: When the tips temperature exceeds about 380[U+2103] to 390U+2103
